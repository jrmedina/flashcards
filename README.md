## Objective
- Build off of a boiler plate repository
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Potentially a timer as well if the `CLI` allows

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- ES6 classes
- TDD, Mocha, Chai

## Features
- A terminal interface that welcomes the guest and informs them on the game they will be playing
- A round tracker, giving the user 30 different cards to play
- A final percentage grade based on the amount of incorrect answers the user has made given as feedback

## Possible Future Extensions
- Add more cards for the user to play
- Seperate the cards based on topics
- Continously display the round and percentage to inform the user how they are doing
